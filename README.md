In K-Means clustering, the algorithm partitions data into k clusters by minimizing the distances between points and their cluster centroids
K-Means Clustering groups similar data points into clusters without needing labeled data. It is used to uncover hidden patterns when the goal is to organize data based on similarity.

Helps identify natural groupings in unlabeled datasets
Works by grouping points based on distance to cluster centers
Commonly used in customer segmentation, image compression, and pattern discovery
Useful when you need structure from raw, unorganized data

# K-Means-Clustering
This project will deepen your understanding of clustering and unsupervised learning by implementing the K-Means algorithm from scratch.

The purpose of this project 

• Implement K-Means manually with Python functions

• Compute distances, update centroids, and assign clusters

• Evaluate clustering results using error metrics

• Use the elbow method to identify the optimal number of clusters
